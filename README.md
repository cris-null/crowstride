# crowstride
A minimal manga tracker.

# Why use crowstride?
Use this software to keep track of the manga you've read from various sources, e.g., you might have read x chapters with a physical book, but y chapters in the official "Manga PLUS" app.

# Where did the name come from?
I got it from a random fantasy name generator set for Kobold names. You can get it [here](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/kobold-names.php).
